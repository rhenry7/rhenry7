Hey I'm Ramone! I have 2+ years of experience as a SWE. I am also experienced with TypeScript, NEXT.js React, Redux and Redux-Saga.  With several years of UX/UI experience I can bring a unique perspective to creative problem-solving for mobile and web applications. I am always interested and eager to learn new technologies and contribute to projects that are innovative and forward-thinking.
